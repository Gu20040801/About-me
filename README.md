 Hello! Iâ€™m Andrew Gu, a third year Computer Science major at Simon Fraser University. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and AI, with skills in programming, software, and architectural drawing. Beyond academics, I enjoy staying activeâ€”especially in badminton, where I competed and achieved runner-up in the Provincial U19 Games in 2021!
